## How to use this as your GitHub front page

1. **Profile README**

   * Create (or edit) the repository named exactly your GitHub username (e.g. `your-username/your-username`).
   * Add this file as `README.md` in the repo root. It will show on your profile automatically.

2. **GitHub Pages (optional)**

   * Create a branch called `gh-pages` or use `main` and enable Pages in repo settings.
   * Rename or copy this file to `index.md` and place it in the root of the branch used for Pages.

3. **Deploy**

```bash
# clone your profile repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-username.git
cd your-username
# add or update README.md with this content
